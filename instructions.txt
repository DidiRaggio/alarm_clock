Description

No more hiding from your alarm clock! You've decided you want your computer to keep you updated on the time so you're never late again. A talking clock takes a 24-hour time and translates it into words. Use the audio clips attached (or a library/API of your choosing) to give your clock a voice. Ensure that module and method docstrings are included. Ensure that unit testing is included.
